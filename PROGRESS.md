## Current phase: Phase 8 — Export & CLI

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-8-export-cli.md`](docs/progress/phase-8-export-cli.md).

A reviewed contract can now be **shipped as a standalone dApp** (ADR-009). The
portable artifact is a **`SemanticBundle`** (`packages/export`) — identity + ABI +
reviewed manifest in one validated JSON. The studio exports it with one click; the
**`semantic-dapp` CLI** (`packages/cli`) produces it headlessly (`bundle`),
scaffolds a standalone app (`export`) and previews it (`serve`); and the
**`generated-app` template** (`apps/generated-app`) renders any bundle at runtime,
analyzer-free, hostable on any static host. See
[ADR-009](docs/adr/ADR-009-export-bundle-template.md) and
[`docs/export.md`](docs/export.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 7 — Safety & Diagnostics

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-7-safety-diagnostics.md`](docs/progress/phase-7-safety-diagnostics.md).

The generated app is now **hardened against adversarial input** (ADR-008). A pure
safety core in `spec` sanitizes untrusted strings (`sanitizeText` strips
bidi/zero-width/control characters and flags mixed-script homoglyphs) and computes
**preflight `writeWarnings`** (wrong network, unverified source, stale manifest,
critical risk). A `SafeText` component wraps every untrusted label (token
name/symbol, contract name) with a ⚠ marker, the **ConfirmDialog surfaces the
preflight warnings** before sending, and the studio keeps a local, exportable
**execution history** (audit trail) of every transaction. See
[ADR-008](docs/adr/ADR-008-safety-diagnostics.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 6 — Trusted UI Components

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-6-trusted-ui.md`](docs/progress/phase-6-trusted-ui.md).

The generated app now renders **purpose-built consoles** instead of one form per
function (ADR-007): an **Overview** summary, a grouped **Pause** console and
**Role manager**, and a reusable **ConfirmDialog** that gates every high/critical
or privileged write (critical actions require typing `CONFIRM`). Dispatch is by
`operationType` grouping; presentational components stay runtime-free in
`components`, wiring lives in `renderer`, and ERC-20 transfer/approve are no
longer duplicated on the User tab. See
[ADR-007](docs/adr/ADR-007-trusted-ui-dispatch.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 5 — Classification & Routing

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-5-classification-routing.md`](docs/progress/phase-5-classification-routing.md).

Classification is now a **priority-based rule engine** (ADR-006). Standards stay
authoritative (priority 100); **name/risk heuristics** route the many functions
no standard describes — custom setters → Admin (`admin-config`), `rescue`/`sweep`
→ high-risk `fund-withdraw`, `pause*` → Emergency, `claim`/`harvest` → User — and
**view functions surface in the Read tab**. Each field is resolved by priority,
**evidence accumulates from every matching rule**, permissions are attached from
the access model, and unknown writers still fall back to Raw (ADR-001). See
[ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-classification-rule-engine.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 4 — Standards Analyzer

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-4-standards-analyzer.md`](docs/progress/phase-4-standards-analyzer.md).

Detection now goes well beyond ERC-20. A **generic member-based engine** powers
detectors for **ERC-721 / ERC-1155 / ERC-4626** and the **Ownable /
AccessControl / Pausable / Upgradeable (UUPS)** capabilities. A **registry**
merges the semantics of all detected standards, the classifier routes each
function accordingly (NFT transfers → User, roles → Admin, pause/unpause →
Emergency, upgrade → critical) and attaches an **access-model permission**
(`ownable` / `access-control`). See
[ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-standards-detection.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 3 — Semantic Manifest

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-3-semantic-manifest.md`](docs/progress/phase-3-semantic-manifest.md).

The manifest (ADR-002) is now a first-class artifact: **import/export round-trip**,
a **form + raw-JSON editor**, **reviewed edits survive re-analyze**
(`mergeReviewed`), **staleness detection** by implementation code hash, and a
**versioned schema with a migration framework**. See
[ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-manifest-versioning.md).

## Previous phase: Phase 2 — Address Resolver

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-2-address-resolver.md`](docs/progress/phase-2-address-resolver.md).

`address + chainId → resolver (Sourcify / block-explorer) → EIP-1967 proxy
detection → ABI + provenance → normalize → classify → generated app`. Package
`packages/resolver` (18 unit tests); studio **By address** import + provenance
badge. See [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-resolver-adapters.md). Deferred small
enhancements: [`docs/progress/backlog.md`](docs/progress/backlog.md).

## Phase 1 — Vertical Slice to v0.0.1

Detailed checklist: [`docs/progress/phase-1-vertical-slice.md`](docs/progress/phase-1-vertical-slice.md).

## Vertical slice at a glance

`Manual ABI → normalized ContractModel → ERC-20 detector → classifier → semantic
manifest → generated User/Admin/Raw app → wallet transaction (Anvil)`.

Packages: `spec`, `execution`, `components`, `renderer`, `analyzer`, `classifier`

## Releasing `v0.0.1`

The code is release-ready. To cut the tag (run manually when you're ready):

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: Phase 1 vertical slice (v0.0.1)"
git tag v0.0.1
```
